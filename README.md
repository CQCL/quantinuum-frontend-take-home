# Quantinuum - Frontend Interview Question

## Requirements
- Use React + Typescript (this repo template will help)
- Use Quantinuum UI component library

## Problem Statement

A customer (non-expert) is a keen player of competitive pokemon and would like a browser based tool to assist in building a team. The web form should allow the user to:
- Search for a pokemon by name.
- Show that pokemonâ€™s weaknesses.
- Show which moves deal double damage to that pokemon.
- Let the user find which pokemon can learn those moves.

The client has not specified where the information should come from, but there are public APIs such as PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2), which can be used to obtain the necessary information. As a large amount of data may end up being queried, some attention should be given to avoiding excessive data fetching.
