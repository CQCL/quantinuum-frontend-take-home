## Problem Statement

Cat Viewer

A customer is a keen connoisseur of cat photographs and wants to have a web interface to be able to explore a range of cat photographs on the internet.

The customer has requested a web client that allows them to browse the [CATAAS (Cat as a service) API](https://cataas.com/) for pictures with a particular tag. They would like to be able to see the available tags provided by the API, such as cats with "hats" or "cute" cats and then be able to view all cats that have those tags on a single page. They would then like to be able to select one of the cats and add some text to the photograph using the API. The customer has requested that, as this is a public API, data fetching should be kept to a minimum and requests should be cached in the browser.

Using the project skeleton provided, write a browser application that provides the requested functionality. You may use any typescript libraries you feel appropriate.
